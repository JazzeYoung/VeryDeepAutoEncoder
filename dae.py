 This tutorial introduces denoising auto-encoders using Theano. 

 Denoising autoencoders can be used as building blocks for deep networks. 
 They are based on auto-encoders as the ones used in Bengio et al. 2007.
 An autoencoder takes an input x and first maps it to a hidden representation
 y = f_{\theta}(x) = s(Wx+b), parameterized by \theta={W,b}. The resulting 
 latent representation y is then mapped back to a "reconstructed" vector 
 z \in [0,1]^d in input space z = g_{\theta'}(y) = s(W'y + b').  The weight 
 matrix W' can optionally be constrained such that W' = W^T, in which case 
 the autoencoder is said to have tied weights. The network is trained such 
 that to minimize the reconstruction error (the error between x and z).

 For the denosing autoencoder, during training, first x is corrupted into 
 \tilde{x}, where \tilde{x} is a partially destroyed version of x by means 
 of a stochastic mapping. Afterwards y is computed as before (using 
 \tilde{x}), y = s(W\tilde{x} + b) and z as s(W'y + b'). The reconstruction 
 error is now measured between z and the uncorrupted input x, which is 
 computed as the cross-entropy : 
      - \sum_{k=1}^d[ x_k \log z_k + (1-x_k) \log( 1-z_k)]
 
 For X iteration of the main program loop it takes *** minutes on an 
 Intel Core i7 and *** minutes on GPU (NVIDIA GTX 285 graphics processor).

  A denoising autoencoders tried to reconstruct the input from a corrupted 
  version of it by projecting it first in a latent space and reprojecting 
  it in the input space. Please refer to Vincent et al.,2008 for more 
  details. If x is the input then equation (1) computes a partially destroyed
  version of x by means of a stochastic mapping q_D. Equation (2) computes 
  the projection of the input into the latent space. Equation (3) computes 
  the reconstruction of the input, while equation (4) computes the
