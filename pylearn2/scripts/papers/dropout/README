The two yaml files in this folder are to reproduce MNIST results of the original dropout paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580.

mnist_valid.yaml: use some portion of data for validation and reaches 1.08% error rate.
mnist.yaml uses same hyperparameters as above but uses the whole training set. It will stop at the same epoch that mnist_valid.yaml reaches its best validation error. And results in 1.05% test error.

1.10% is the error reported in original dropout paper.
1.05% is the error reported in  Nitish Srivastava's master thesis.
